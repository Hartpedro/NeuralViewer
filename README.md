Program, which shows how neural networks learn

Program let you to notice how weights of connections change in time. On the screen you can see one of the test sample. During learning process it is easier for computer to predict what number is on the screen. Look which neuron is the brightest one on the bottom, last layer. It says what computer deduce about the number. (first neuron on the left mean 0)
